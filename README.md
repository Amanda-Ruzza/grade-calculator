# Grade Calculator

## Python Script that calculates a grade based on user input.

### How it works:
The user is prompted to input 5 test score results, and the program will calculate the average number, and provide a final grade. 
Utilizes Exception/Error handling to avoid inproper user input.
Based on the average score, the program should determine the corresponding letter grade using the following grading scale:

    ```
    90 or above: A
    80-89: B
    70-79: C
    60-69: D
    Below 60: F

    Sample program behaviour:

    Enter test score 1: 75 
    Enter test score 2: 82 
    Enter test score 3: 92 
    Enter test score 4: 68 
    Enter test score 5: 78 
    ---------------------------- 
    Average score: 79.0 
    Letter grade: C
    ```
